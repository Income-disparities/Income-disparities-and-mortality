Voters in both U.S. major political parties are frustrated with income disparities, whether it’s Republican anger at “coastal elitists” or Democratic anger at the “upper 1%”. The 2024 platforms of the two major parties both advocated for tax reductions to "[workers](https://gop.com/press-release/icymi-rnc-platform-committee-adopts-2024-republican-party-platform/)" or "[working families](https://democrats.org/where-we-stand/party-platform/)."

What is the relationship between the income disparities (as measured by the [Gini Coefficient](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gini_coefficient) for income) and all-cause mortality in the U.S.?

**Summary:** 
This meta-analysis suggests that the effectiveness of the clinical intervention *is* [moderate](https://training.cochrane.org/handbook/current/chapter-15#section-15-5-3-1). [Standarized mean differences](https://training.cochrane.org/handbook/current/chapter-15#section-15-3) betweeen intervention and control groups across outcomes range from x to y. 

Heterogeneity of results as measured by I<sup>2</sup> '[might not be important](https://training.cochrane.org/handbook/current/chapter-10#section-10-10-2)' at x% for all analyses; however very wide confidence intervals reflect the small number of studies and subjects. 

Meta-regression of common modulators (year of publication, study size, event rate in the control groups) has not been done due to the small number of studies.

This review updates previously published meta-analysis(es).(citation[s] below)
